                    Of the four sojourns of Guru Nanak Devji, the second one covered Deccan and SriLanka, during which he passed through Bidar, where, in response to the prayers of local inhabitants, he touched the rock with his right toe and a perenial fresh water spring continues to flow to this day. Thus it begot the name SRI NANAK JHIRA SAHEB.
                    A prabandhak committee was formed in 1950 to renovate and develop Gurdwara under the Presidenship of Pant Bhushan Sant Sardar Bhishan Singhji. Unfortunately in the year 1966, Santji expired and the mantle fell on the shoulders of his son Sardar Joga Singhji who continued to provide stewardship to the Prabandhak Committee to the welfare and up-liftment of Human Society.                 
                    As developing activities were growing fast, a public, Religious, Educational and Charitable trust by the name Sri Nanak Jhira Saheb Foundation was established in March 1987 by the Prabandhak Committee Gurudwara Sri Nanak Jhira Saheb, Bidar.
